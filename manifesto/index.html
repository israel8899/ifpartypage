<section>
  <h2>A Zionist Crisis—And a Choice</h2>
  <p>Israel was not built to become a country where its citizens struggle to live in it.</p>
  <p>Yet today, the Zionist promise is slipping away for millions of Israelis. Housing has become unaffordable. Wages are suppressed. The job market is distorted by mass foreign labor. And national decisions are increasingly shaped by foreign pressure rather than the will of the Israeli public.</p>
  <p>This is not a coincidence. It is the result of choices.</p>
  <div class="callout">
    We feed our enemies because of international demands.<br>
    We halt annexation and dismantle Jewish settlement because of American demands.<br>
    We suppress wages and flood the labor market because of corporate demands.
  </div>
  <p>Meanwhile, an out-of-touch ruling class is more concerned with approval from Washington, Brussels, and global elites than with whether young Israeli families can afford a home, build wealth, or remain in the country at all.</p>
  <p>Zionism was never meant to produce a nation of permanent renters, disposable workers, and strategic dependents.</p>
  <p><strong>Israel First exists to revive the Zionist dream—by restoring ownership, opportunity, sovereignty, and permanence to Israeli life.</strong></p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Rebuilding a Strong Working Class</h2>
  <p>Israel was built by workers—not by intermediaries, rent-seekers, or imported labor schemes.</p>
  <p>A Zionist economy is one that <strong>produces, builds, and employs its own people</strong>. When a nation hollows out its working class, it hollows out its resilience.</p>
  <p>Over the past decades, mass waves of foreign labor—especially in construction—have displaced Israeli workers, suppressed wages, and stripped entire sectors of long-term Israeli participation.</p>
  <p>Israel First rejects this model and proposes a clear course correction.</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Severely minimize foreign labor</strong> in core industries</li>
    <li>Limit foreign workers to <strong>temporary roles</strong> from countries with positive relations</li>
    <li><strong>Permanently exclude hostile entities</strong> from the labor market</li>
    <li>Launch <strong>national training programs</strong> for skilled domestic workers</li>
    <li>Prioritize <strong>domestic manufacturing</strong> in key industries</li>
  </ul>
  <p>This approach strengthens jobs, restores wages, and ensures strategic independence against politically motivated embargoes or sanctions.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Annexation: The Solution to the Housing Crisis</h2>
  <p>Homeownership is the most reliable path to generational wealth. Without it, families remain paycheck-to-paycheck their whole lives.</p>
  <p>Vast areas of <strong>Area C</strong>, under full Israeli control, remain politically frozen. This restricts supply and drives prices nationwide.</p>
  <p>Israel First is clear: <strong>annexation is the solution</strong>. Permanent Israeli communities and housing will create stability and ownership nationwide. Conservative estimates suggest sustained expansion could reduce housing prices by <strong>15–30%</strong> over time.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Sovereignty Through Strategic Balance</h2>
  <p>Israel is a sovereign state—not a vassal.</p>
  <p>Israel’s greatest strategic mistake has been believing it has no options. That no country besides the United States would value partnership with us. This illusion has allowed others to leverage Israel economically, diplomatically, and militarily.</p>
  <p>Israel has not failed.<br>Israel has been exploited.</p>
  <p>Israel First will maintain cooperation with the United States where interests align—but will reject arrangements that trade sovereignty for approval. Israel will pursue a <strong>balanced geopolitical strategy</strong>, expanding partnerships so no single nation holds leverage over Israel’s security, economy, or future.</p>
  <p>The Israeli public is the sovereign. Not foreign governments. Not foreign interests.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Military Independence and the End of Strategic Humiliation</h2>
  <p>Ceasefires. Negotiations. Prisoner releases. Humanitarian aid to enemies.</p>
  <p>Despite having the strongest military in the region, Israel has allowed foreign nations to negotiate the terms of wars we have already won.</p>
  <p>This is not restraint. It is managed defeat.</p>
  <p>Israel must be capable of producing all weapons, munitions, and systems required to fight and win its wars—without permission.</p>
  <p>The <strong>Lavi</strong> fighter jet program was cancelled under American pressure in the 1980s. Israel has the world’s best combat pilots; it is time to restart sovereign weapons development.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>National Cohesion</h2>
  <p>Israel has been divided deliberately. Secular vs religious. Ashkenazi vs Sephardi. Tel Aviv vs Judea and Samaria.</p>
  <p>We need the hi-tech innovators and settlers. Torah scholars and secular leaders. These are complementary strengths.</p>
  <p>We have enough enemies. There is no sense in fighting each other.</p>
  <p>National cohesion is shared destiny, not uniformity.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>A Call to Citizens</h2>
  <p>Israel First is not left or right. It is forward.</p>
  <p>It restores ownership, opportunity, sovereignty, and permanence to Israeli life. When Israelis can afford homes, earn dignified wages, defend themselves, and live without foreign coercion, Zionism is renewed.</p>
  <p><strong>This is Israel First.</strong></p>
