  <h1>Israel First</h1>
  <p>A Manifesto for a State That Serves Its Citizens</p>
</header>

<main>

<section>
  <h2>This Is the Moment</h2>
  <p>Israel is strong—but Israeli citizens are being ignored.</p>
  <p>Salaries lag behind costs. Jobs are scarce. Home ownership is a dream of the past. Policy too often serves systems, intermediaries, and powerful interests instead of the people who carry the country on their backs.</p>
  <p>Israel First exists to reverse that equation.</p>
  <p>This movement is built on a clear conviction: a nation that does not put its citizens first will eventually fail them all.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>What “Israel First” Means</h2>
  <p>Israel First is not isolationism. It is responsibility.</p>
  <p>It means:</p>
  <p>National Interests come before Foreign Interests</p>
  <p>Citizens come before Corporations</p>
  <p>Sovereignty comes before Dependence.</p>
  <p>A strong Israel begins at home—with people who can live, work, and build a future with dignity.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Work, Wages, and a Fair Economy</h2>
  <p>Israel was built by work—and work must once again be able to support a life of dignity.</p>
  <p>Today, Israeli workers are being forced to compete in a distorted labor market. Mass foreign labor is used to suppress wages, reduce job availability, and shift risk onto working families, all while enriching oligarchs, large contractors, and real estate developers who profit from artificially cheap labor.</p>
  <p>Israel First is clear:</p>
  <p>Israeli workers must come first in the Israeli labor market.</p>
  <p>Wages must reflect real demand, skill, and productivity—not policy-driven suppression.</p>
  <p>Profit is legitimate, but exploitation is not.</p>
  <p>We believe business owners have the right to succeed and profit from productive enterprises. But a fair market requires fair competition—and there is nothing fair about forcing Israeli workers to compete against a permanently underpaid labor pool imported to drive wages down.</p>
  <p>Israel First will work to drastically reduce reliance on foreign labor and rebuild a labor market that rewards work, training, and contribution. Where foreign labor is necessary, it will be strictly limited, carefully regulated, and sourced only from countries that maintain positive and cooperative relations with the State of Israel.</p>
  <p>Work permits originating from Gaza, the Palestinian Authority, and East Jerusalem will be fully and permanently revoked so long as those entities remain hostile to the State of Israel and its citizens. Israeli workers should not bear the economic cost of ongoing hostility.</p>
  <p>An economy that serves insiders at the expense of its working class is not competitive—it is captured. Israel First stands for a labor market and economy that work for citizens, not against them.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Housing Is a National Crisis</h2>
  <p>Home ownership should not be a fantasy.</p>
  <p>When the average family cannot afford to buy a home, we have a crisis on our hands.</p>
  <p>When working families cannot afford stability, the social contract breaks. Housing policy must serve living communities—not speculation, delay, or artificial scarcity.</p>
  <p>Israel First treats housing affordability as a national priority, tied directly to economic resilience and social cohesion.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>National Development and Strategic Expansion</h2>
  <p>Israel is a small country with big pressures—and artificial limits.</p>
  <p>Israel First believes that long-term prosperity, housing affordability, and national resilience require strategic national development and expansion in areas vital to Israel’s security, history, and future. Responsible expansion of Israeli communities, infrastructure, and economic activity strengthens sovereignty, reduces internal congestion, and unlocks growth.</p>
  <p>This vision—often described as Greater Israel—is not about recklessness or ideology for its own sake. It is about:</p>
  <p>Expanding the space in which Israelis can live, work, and build families</p>
  <p>Reducing housing scarcity that drives prices beyond reach</p>
  <p>Creating new economic corridors for industry, logistics, and innovation</p>
  <p>Anchoring national security through civilian presence and development</p>
  <p>A nation that does not grow deliberately is forced to suffocate internally. Strategic expansion is not a luxury—it is an economic necessity.</p>
  <p>Israel First supports development that is lawful, responsible, and aligned with Israel’s long-term national interest, ensuring that growth serves citizens rather than speculation or stagnation.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>National Cohesion</h2>
  <p>For decades, politicians and special interests have divided Israeli society into warring camps—secular versus religious, Ashkenazi versus Sephardi, Judea and Samaria settlers versus Tel Aviv urbanites. This fragmentation weakens us all.</p>
  <p>Israel First rejects politics of division. We need each other.</p>
  <p>We need the innovation and global reach of Tel Aviv’s hi-tech sector. We need the settlers who expand, anchor, and protect our borders. We need those who study Torah and sustain Israel’s Jewish character—and we need secular thinkers who challenge, create, and lead.</p>
  <p>These are not competing identities. They are complementary strengths.</p>
  <p>Israel has more than enough enemies. There is no sense in fighting each other.</p>
  <p>National cohesion is not conformity. It is mutual recognition, shared purpose, and respect across difference. A strong Israel is built when every community knows it belongs—and knows it is needed.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Strategic Autonomy and Global Partnerships</h2>
  <p>Israel is a sovereign state—not a client and not a vassal.</p>
  <p>Today, political and military leaders too often fly to Washington to ask for permission. Israel First rejects this posture outright. We want a government that asks the Israeli public for permission—because in a democracy, the people are the sovereign.</p>
  <p>For decades, Israel has been strategically constrained and economically leveraged by the United States in ways that have limited Israeli freedom of action, distorted national priorities, and imposed costs borne by Israeli citizens. This is not a failure of Israel—but the predictable outcome of asymmetric dependence.</p>
  <p>Israel First is clear: being taken advantage of is not an alliance—it is a liability. That era must end.</p>
  <p>While cooperation with the United States will continue where interests align, Israel will no longer accept arrangements that trade sovereignty for approval or independence for short-term cover.</p>
  <p>We will act to broaden Israel’s strategic, economic, and diplomatic partnerships across multiple regions and powers, ensuring that no single country—or foreign interest—holds leverage over Israel’s security, economy, or future.</p>
  <p>It is time to take back our sovereignty. The Israeli public is the sovereign—not foreign nations and not foreign interests. Israel must engage the world as an independent power—confident, self-directed, and accountable only to its citizens.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>A Call to Citizens</h2>
  <p>Israel First is not about left or right.</p>
  <p>It is about up and forward.</p>
  <p>It is about restoring balance between effort and reward, between contribution and opportunity, between the citizen and the state.</p>
  <p>This movement belongs to those who work, build, serve, and believe that Israel can do better—for its people.</p>
  <p>When housing is affordable, work is rewarded, sovereignty answers only to the Israeli public, and our communities stand together, Israel becomes stronger at home, freer abroad, and united in purpose—this is Israel First.</p>
